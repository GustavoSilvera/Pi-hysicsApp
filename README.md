# Pi Collision Simulation

Inspired by G. Galperin's 2003 paper on [Playing Pool With Pi](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf)

This simulation aims to verify and appreciate the ridiculously imaginative mathematical concept of completely idealized physics collisions with the number of collisions approaching the famous irrational number, pi.
